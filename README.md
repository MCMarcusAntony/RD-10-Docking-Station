# RD-10-Docking-Station
A DIY Docking Station for the Casio MX-10 / MX-15 MSX computers

Designed to replace or substitute the KB-10 or KB-15 docking station.  This provides two additional cartridge slots, +/12V rails for those cartridge slots, and an audio input.  Future releases may expand this design.  For now, consider it a way to have more than one catridge in your MX-10 or MX-15 at a time.
